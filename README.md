Since rediqueue is intended to be used in unittests TTLs don't decrease
automatically. You can use `TTL()` to get the TTL (as a time.Duration) of a
key. It will return 0 when no TTL is set. EXPIREAT and PEXPIREAT values will be
converted to a duration. For that you can either set m.SetTime(t) to use that
time as the base for the (P)EXPIREAT conversion, or don't call SetTime(), in
which case time.Now() will be used.
`m.FastForward(d)` can be used to decrement all TTLs. All TTLs which become <=
0 will be removed.
